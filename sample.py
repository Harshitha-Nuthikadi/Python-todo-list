# f"{x}" is called an f-string in Python. Itâ€™s a formatted string literal that lets you insert variables directly inside a string.

# numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15]
# search = 10

# for num in numbers:
#     if num == search:
#         print(f"Found {search}! Stopping the search.")
#         break
#     if num % 3 != 0:
#         print(num)


for num in range(1,10):
    print(num*num)
